mcradia
=======

<a href="http://www.esrf.eu/Accelerators/Groups/InsertionDevices/Software/Radia">Radia</a> is a scientific software for 3D magnetostatics calculations developed in 1997 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble (F) by O. Chubar, J. Chavanne and P. Ellaume.

The C/C++ code, originally build to work as a Mathematica extension via MathLink, can be compiled as a front-end independent dll library and with Python bindings via SWIG.

mcradia is a fork of Radia v4.30 to expand its functionality to tracking the trajectory and precession of neutrons in an arbitrary magnetic field generated by permanent magnets or current coils.

The aim is to embed numerical propagation in magnetic fields within the general framework of a Monte Carlo neutron ray tracing simulation, such as the popular <a href="http://www.mcstas.org">McStas</a> implementation for neutron scattering instrumentation.

<a href="ttps://github.com/aprodi/mcradia">mcradia</a> (<a href="http://www.mcstas.org">McStas</a>  + <a href="http://www.esrf.eu/Accelerators/Groups/InsertionDevices/Software/Radia">Radia</a>) will interface the two codes at low level.
